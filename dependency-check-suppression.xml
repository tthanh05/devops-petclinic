  <!--
    HOW TO USE:
    - Add an entry only when you have verified a finding is a false-positive
      for THIS project/version. Prefer fixing/upgrading first.
    - Always leave a short justification and a removal date checkpoint.
    - Example below suppresses a mistaken CPE match on a provided-only JAR.

  <!-- EXAMPLE: False positive on test-scoped dependency (not shipped at runtime) -->
  <suppress until="2026-01-01">
    <notes>
      Sonatype coordinates: org.example:demo-helper:1.0 is test-scoped only and not part of runtime artifacts.
      CVE-2023-XXXX reported via CPE fuzzy match does not apply to this coordinate/version.
      Verified by inspecting target/surefire-reports classpath and final JAR contents.
    </notes>
    <cve>CVE-2023-XXXX</cve>
    <gav regex="true">^org\.example:demo-helper:.*$</gav>
  </suppress>

  <!-- EXAMPLE: JUnit (test scope only; not shipped at runtime) -->
  <suppress until="2026-01-01">
    <notes>
      JUnit Jupiter is used only for unit/integration tests and is not included in the runtime artifact.
      Suppressing CVEs for org.junit.jupiter modules prevents build failures on non-runtime libraries.
      Verified by inspecting the final JAR/BOOT-INF and dependency tree: test scope only.
    </notes>
    <!-- If your report lists a specific CVE for JUnit, put it here; otherwise omit <cve> to suppress all for this GAV. -->
    <!-- <cve>CVE-20xx-xxxx</cve> -->
    <gav regex="true">^org\.junit\.jupiter:.*$</gav>
  </suppress>

  <!-- EXAMPLE: Mockito (test scope only; not shipped at runtime) -->
  <suppress until="2026-01-01">
    <notes>
      Mockito is used strictly in tests and never packaged into the application binary.
      This suppression documents the decision and avoids blocking on test-only CVEs.
      Verified via 'mvn dependency:tree' and by checking the built JAR contents.
    </notes>
    <!-- Insert a specific CVE from your report if present; otherwise leave only the GAV matcher. -->
    <!-- <cve>CVE-20xx-xxxx</cve> -->
    <gav regex="true">^org\.mockito:mockito-core:.*$</gav>
  </suppress>
